# Specification
  
- Running the project starts with the main menu of this recipe, a graphical interface.
- These six functions are available on the main menu. The user can use those functions to loop up the information of:
  - existing dishes, 
    - to delete or update
  - add new dishes, 
  - write comments on dishes, 
  - upload videos about how to cook, 
  - get a recommendation,
  - find the browsing history of this recipe.
- For each dish, there should be classified as:
  - cuisine that this dish belongs to, 
  - the standard ingredients of this dish, 
  - the necessary tools for cooking this dish, 
  - and the cooking method of this dish. 
- Those classifications we called as crucial points of the dish. If any of the crucial points is **missing**, the dish will be tagged **"incomplete"** and the user will be alerted to add information every time he opens the main menu. 
- Recall the crucial points, we said that two dishes are similar, if at least two of the crucial points are the same. Given an existing dish, the user can get a list of all existing similar dishes.
- For each dish, users can add information or what we called the optional points of the dish:
  - the average time the dish takes to cook, 
  - the number of times it has been cooked, 
  - comments on it. 
- The recipe can calculate and record the average time for cooking the dish. The average time gets updated every time the user inputs a new time. That means that the user who want to use this function may need to record how long it takes to cook a certain existing dish every time the user cooks it.
- Existing dishes also can be classified by:
  - similarity, 
  - the time it takes to cook, 
  - the number of times it has been cooked. 
- The user can get recommendations according to the result of the classification. The user can also manually label a dish as "favorite". Dishes labeled as "favorite" are always recommended first regardless of the classification way.

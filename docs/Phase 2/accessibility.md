##1. Principle of Universal Design
- ###Principle 1: Equitable Use
    a) Our program doesn't ask for providing gender while signing up a new user in order to avoid segregating and stigmatizing any users.

    b) All users can access the full features of our program, each user enjoy the identical experience.

    c) All users are asked to provide a password to help protect their privacy.

- ###Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
    Our program doesn't have too many features support this principle since we don't have enough time to develop different use methods.

    We can simplify the command to help facilitate the user's accuracy. Also, graphic operating system can be added to our program which provide different use methods.

- ###Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
  a) Our program is a cooking recipe program, and we eliminate unnecessary complexity such as add a timer.
  
  b) The command for the program is consistent with user intuition.
  
  c) The information of the recipe is arranged with its importance.
  
  d) Essential message is provided after some important operation.

- ###Principle 4: Perceptible Information
    According to the project size, we are unable to give redundant presentation of information using pictures to support this principle.
    
    We can add a user interface to help present information like pictures of the food.

- ###Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
    a) The syntax of commands for our program is strict in order to avoid unexpected error.
    
  b) There is feedback message after an error appear to the user, so that our users can know what is going on.

- ###Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
    a) Since our program can work on a computer, it allows user to maintain a neutral body position.
    
  b) Our program minimize repetitive actions and users can easily access the recipe they want to find.

- ###Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
  Since we don't have a graphic user interface, the size and space actually depend on users' computer setting.

  After we add GUI to our program, we can make the size of the characters adjustable to support this principle.

##2. Who we would market our program towards
  Our program is marketing towards people who like cooking and want a simple and easy-use recipe organizing program. The recipe programs or recipe websites now we have are found to be unnecessary redundant.
  For example, they usually have some features like timer,even calendar. For people who only want to have a simple program which they can view recipes details, follow the instructions, and save recipes to favorite lists, our design fits their needs perfectly.
  
##3. Our program is less likely to be used by certain demographics
  Obviously, our program will not be used by people who never cooking. Since our program does not involve graphs in it, people who want graph and pictures along the texts may be less likely to use it.
  Also, for people who want additional tools such as timer to help them to cook, our program may not satisfy them.
